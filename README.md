## Learning Points

The main take away from this project is using React to create and develop an app. Some features of React make this much easier than previous projects. For example you are able to to work on specific components individually without messing with the rest of the app, the other components can remain functional. Additionally you can have the app connected to the browser locally while you build. These features make things go much smoother while developing and troubleshooting your app, and I can see how they would be a big help when working on a project with other people.
